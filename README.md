# Digital Communications MATLAB Simulation

<!-- Overview -->
## Overview
This report demonstrates a designed digital communication system optimized to have minimum bit error rate while maximizing the transmitted message bits per second. The system is designed in reference to a given channel with an unknown constant frequency band limitation and unknown variable transmission delay. The simulation of the
designed system is conducted in the MATLAB software.
