% INCLUDED FILES:
%   - root_raised_cosine.m : A given RRC signal function
%   - channel.p : The given channel

% DO NOT RUN EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME:
%   - Certain components are disabled for simulation speed or have conditional requirements.
%   - In general, reduce the number of frames (Nf) to increase simulation speed   
%   - The current simulation setup is for various BER values for a RRC pulse

% If you are looking at PSD, disable BER calculations:
%   - Disable SNR loop
%   - Disable Channel
%   - Disable Reciever 
%   - Choose whether you are looking at multiple PSD or singular (NOT BOTH)
%   - Disable BER plots

% If you are looking at BER, disable PSD calculations:
%   - Disable all PSD calculations
%   - Disable PSD plot

% Loop for variable parameters:
%   - This is only for the figures generated for the report.
%   - Several plots at once for varying parameter values.
%   - These simulations take a while due to repetitive simulations loops
%   - Disable if not looking at varying paramter values.
